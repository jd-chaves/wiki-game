# wiki-game
This project was made during the course of [Web Dev]( http://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2018/) at Universidad de los Andes. With this app you will be able to play WikiGame with your friends. The goal is to choose a Wikipedia page and reach to another Wikipedia page, but only through the outgoing links of the current page along the path. You can create a game or join an existing one. You can visualize the graph that is generated by the game, which is built based on the discovered pages and the discovered links.


```
git clone https://github.com/jcpinilla/wiki-game.git
wiki-game
meteor npm install
meteor
```
The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Finally, you can test the app by running

```
meteor test --driver-package cultofcoders:mocha --port 3100
```
The test results are displayed in [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).
